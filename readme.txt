This is a simple text editor made using html, css and javascript.

Some of the things used explained here-
* document.execCommand() has been depriciated, but still works great. It is used 
to perform functions on text where the first parameter represents the command to be executed like
backcolor, bold, heading etc. The second parameter indicates if the UI should be shown, thirsd arguement
contains value if required.
